# HackTheBox Machines

Repository that contains some personal notes of a Noob for HTB machines that I've succesfully solved or that I expect to solve some day :). Don't look here if you want to find something well structured, this is not a guide to solve the machines. Also be careful as this repository might contain a lot of spoilers of this machines.

## Objectives

Basically this is a way to learn more about pentesting, that's why I'm trying to solve first some defined tracks that are marked as 'Easy' in the platform. These are the tracks that I want to solve and my progress:


* [x] Begginer Track (EASY)
* [X] Intro to Dante (EASY)
* [ ] Pwn With Metasploit (But hopefully without using Metasploit) (EASY)
* [ ] Intro to Binary Exploitation (EASY)
* [ ] OWASP Top 10 (EASY)
* [ ] Intro to Blue Team (EASY)

I will add some future tracks when I'm done with the easiest ones (some day...)

## Annotations

* MachineName(V) -> Machine completed and notes added
* MachineName(X) -> Machine completed but notes missing
* MachineName_Challenge -> Challenges
